# What is Infrastructure as Code (IAC) ?
 
 Let's say, We used to log in to the management console on AWS or Azure or GCP and provision the resource. It is good for limited number of resources. For the organization with huge infrastructure it is not a good practice. For that we came up with the solution called IAC. We will write a simple code with easy and in human readable format to provision the resource.
